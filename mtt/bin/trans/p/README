             NUMERICAL RECIPES PASCAL SHAREWARE DISKETTE

The entire contents of this diskette are
Copyright (C) 1986 by Numerical Recipes Software.

HERE ARE ANSWERS TO YOUR IMMEDIATE QUESTIONS:

** What is this diskette?  ** This NUMERICAL  RECIPES PASCAL SHAREWARE
DISKETTE contains Pascal procedures originally published as the Pascal
Appendix to the FORTRAN book NUMERICAL RECIPES: THE  ART OF SCIENTIFIC
COMPUTING (Cambridge University Press, 1986), and test driver programs
originally published as the  NUMERICAL  RECIPES EXAMPLE BOOK  (PASCAL)
(Cambridge University Press, 1986).

** What kinds of procedures  are these Numerical Recipes? **  They are
practically a complete library for  scientific computation.  Numbering
more than  200,  their scope  includes   integration,  linear algebra,
differential  equations, Fourier methods,  data analysis,  statistics,
lots of special functions, random   numbers,  sorting, root   finding,
optimization, and much more.

** Do I really get this whole library for FREE? ** Yes, providing that
you follow these  simple  rules:   (1) You must   read and accept  the
disclaimer of warranty at the end of this  document.  (2) You must not
expect any  user support from  Numerical Recipes Software,   Cambridge
University Press, or the authors of  the Numerical Recipes books.  (3)
You must not copy  or redistribute any  of  the programs or procedures
for commercial purposes.  You CAN make copies of the programs for your
friends  and    colleagues, providing   that you  include   this  file
(especially its copyright notice and  disclaimer of warranty) with any
copy that you make.

** What's  the  catch, then?  **    None at  all.   Many  thousands of
satisfied users paid more than $20 to purchase exactly the programs on
this disk,  which were sold   by Cambridge  University  Press (C.U.P.)
between 1986 and 1989.  C.U.P.  now sells a  revised  version  of  the
Numerical  Recipes program library,  whose   Pascal  style   is   much
improved, but whose basic algorithmic  workings are identical  to this
disk.  Rather  than  let  the older version go  to waste,  its authors
decided to make it available to the shareware community of users.

** How can I figure out what the procedures do? ** One way is  to read
the brief descriptions of all the programs in the  file NRINFO.DOC.  A
better  way is to  look  at the  book   Numerical Recipes: The  Art of
Scientific Computing  in   any  one of its  three  editions  (FORTRAN,
Pascal, or  C).  If you  don't  want to buy this book   from Cambridge
University Press   (see the file  NRINFO.DOC),  you  can  find   it in
libraries.  Or, take  a pencil and   a small  piece  of paper  into  a
bookstore that carries the book and take  notes  on which programs you
might find interesting.

** How do I figure out how to use  the procedures? **  Again, you have
several  options.   All  the   procedures  (named   *.PAS)  come  with
demonstration  programs  (named *.DEM).   These demonstration programs
are included on this shareware diskette.  (When sold, they are sold as
a separate  diskette.)  Usually  you can figure    out how  to   use a
procedure by figuring out its .DEM program.  Another way is to look at
the Numerical Recipes book in a library or bookstore.

** Aren't you just trying to get me to  buy the book?  **  Think of it
this way: Most shareware comes with the requirement that if you use it
more than casually, you are  required to become  a registered user and
pay a fee.  We are not requiring any  fee at all.   We think that  you
will  be able to  use MOST of the procedures  on this diskette without
the Numerical Recipes book.  If you become a more-than-casual user, or
if you look at the book in a bookstore, we  are betting  that you will
WANT to buy it,  and  perhaps  then  want to purchase  the revised and
improved versions of the programs, also.   But it is completely  up to
you.

** OK, what if I do want to get the book? ** Call Cambridge University
Press at their  toll-free  number,  800-872-7423.  (In  New York  call
800-227-0247 or 914-937-9600.)  Ask for "Numerical Recipes in Pascal",
ISBN  number  0-521-37516-9.  We think  you'll like it.  (Over 100,000
copies of the book are in print, in FORTRAN, Pascal, and C.)

** What  are the files  on this diskette? **  All  the  procedures, in
Pascal source  code, are  in   the ZIP   file NRPAS13.ZIP.   You   use
PKUNZIP.EXE to decompress them.  (For  info  just execute PKUNZIP with
no  command  line  arguments.)  All  the  demonstration  programs  are
similarly in NRPEX10.ZIP (PEX means Pascal EXamples).  Some data files
used by the procedures and demonstrations programs are in NRPDATA.ZIP.
The files NRPAS13.LST and NRPEX10.LST each list the names of the files
in their corresponding ZIP file.   The short file  MODFILE.PAS is used
by many of the  procedures to customize  to your particular variety of
Pascal  compiler; feel free to modify  it, if  you need to.  The  file
NRINFO.DOC tells about the book Numerical Recipes in Pascal and  gives
a   brief description of  all the  procedures.   The  file you are now
reading is NRREADME.DOC.

Good luck, and happy number-crunching!
