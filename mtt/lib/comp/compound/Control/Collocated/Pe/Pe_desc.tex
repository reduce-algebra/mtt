   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Pe} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:Pe_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Pe_lbl}.

\textbf{Pe} implements a collocated P controller where:
\begin{description}
\item[w] is the (flow) setpoint at port [w]
\item[y] is the (flow) system output at port [yu]
\item[u] is the (effort) system input (control signal) at port [yu]
\end{description}

The controller transfer-function is:
\begin{equation}
  u(s) = k_p e(s) 
\end{equation}
where the \emph{error} $e(s) = w(s) - y(s)$.
