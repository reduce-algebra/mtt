   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{pBernoulliEuler} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:pBernoulliEuler_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:pBernoulliEuler_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:pBernoulliEuler_sub}.

This is identical to component  \textbf{pBernoulliEuler} except that a
\emph{piezoelectric patch} is included. This provides:
\begin{enumerate}
\item an moment-generating \emph{actuator} and
\item a curvature \emph{sensor}.
\end{enumerate}
