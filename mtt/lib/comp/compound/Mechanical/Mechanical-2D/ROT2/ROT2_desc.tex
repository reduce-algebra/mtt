   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{ROT2} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{ROT2_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:ROT2_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:ROT2_sub}.

\textbf{ROT2} implements a 2D rotational {\em transformation\/} in
terms of a set of {\em transformers}. A flow expressed in the $XY$
coordinates of Figure \Ref{ROT2_abg} is transformed by \textbf{ROT2}
into the coordinates of $xy$. The corresponding (energy conserving)
effort transformation is implied by \textbf{ROT2}.
