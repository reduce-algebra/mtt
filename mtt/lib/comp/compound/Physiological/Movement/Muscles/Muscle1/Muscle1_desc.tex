   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Muscle1} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:Muscle1_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Muscle1_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Muscle1_sub}.


This model is a highly simplified linear model of a muscle. The two
main components are:
\begin{itemize}
\item a \textbf{CDx} component representing the muscle compliance and
  also providing a measurement of muscle extension and
\item an \textbf{R} component representing mechanical damping in the muscle
\end{itemize}

The component has three ports:
\begin{description}
\item [in] representing the connection of the muscle to the outside world. The
  corresponding force corresponds to the sum of the muscle force and
  the reaction force of connected components.
\item[out] a measurement of the muscle extension.
\item[F] Representing the force component of the muscle model.
\end{description}
