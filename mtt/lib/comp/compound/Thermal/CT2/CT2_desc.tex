   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{CT2} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{CT2_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:CT2_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:CT2_sub}.

\textbf{CT2} is a two port thermal capacitor representing an ideal
heat engine converting heat to work without energy loss. There are two
ports {\bf [in]} (with covariables Temperature (absolute) and
entropy flow) and {\bf [out]} with covariables Pressure and rate of
change of volume. 

Rather than using the corresponding (nonlinear) Constitutive
Relationship (with entropy and volume as states) directly, the
component is built up from a {\em linear\/} two-port capacitor with
internal energy and volume as states. The {\bf ES} component provides
the conversion from the pseudo Bond Graph with temperature (relative)
and enthalpy flow as covariables to the true Bond Graph with with
covariables Temperature (absolute) and entropy flow.

The power-sensor {\bf PS} component is used to subtract the work enrgy
from the internal energy.
