   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Comb} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Comb_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Comb_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Comb_sub}.
   
   This thermal tank model has been developed to represent an ideal
   (and non-dynamic) combustion chamber for a gas turbine. The major
   simplification is that the mass contained in the tank is assumed
   constant -- this is consistent with using an ideal compressor and an
   ideal turbine with identical mass flows. Energy conservatioin is
   ensured by using true bonds and \textbf{TF} components.
