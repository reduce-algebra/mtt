   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Tankp} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Tankp_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Tankp_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Tankp_sub}.

\textbf{Tankp} is a pseudo bond graph based model of a tank storing
(as the two states)
\begin{itemize}
\item enthalpy and 
\item mass
\end{itemize}

There are two versions:
\begin{itemize}
\item the incompressible version where the tank has a pressure-based
  capacitance $c_t$ and
\item the ideal-gas version were the tank has a volume  $v_t$ and $r$
  and $c_p$ are the universal gas constant and the specific heat respectively.
\end{itemize}
