   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{VM} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{VM_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:VM_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:VM_sub}.

The \textbf{VM} component acts as a density-modulated transformer
converting a $P$/$\dot V$ energy bond to a $P$/$\dot m$ pseudo bond. It used
the \textbf{Density} component and therfore inherits the properties of
that component -- in particular it takes the same parameter. The four
ports are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [Hy_in]: hydraulic in
\item [Hy_out]: hydraulic out
\item [P]: Pressure
\item [T]: Temperature
\end{itemize}
