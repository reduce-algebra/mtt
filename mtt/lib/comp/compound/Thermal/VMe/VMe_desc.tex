   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{VMe} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{VMe_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:VMe_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:VMe_sub}.

The \textbf{VMe} component acts as a density-modulated transformer
converting a $P$/$\dot V$ energy bond to a $Pv$/$\dot m$ bond. It used
the \textbf{Density} component and therfore inherits the properties of
that component -- in particular it takes the same parameter. The four
ports are:

\begin{itemize}
\item [Hy_in]: hydraulic in
\item [Hy_out]: hydraulic out
\item [P]: Pressure
\item [T]: Temperature
\end{itemize}
