   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{MaplesonModelP} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{MaplesonModelP_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:MaplesonModelP_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:MaplesonModelP_sub}.

This is a Bond Graph interpretation of Mapleson's model P of the
pharmokokinetics of anaesthetic drug delivery. It is discussed in
detail in Chapter 9 of ``Metamodelling''.

It badly needs conversion to hierarchical form.
