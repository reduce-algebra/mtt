   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{OnePorts} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:OnePorts_abg.ps}; it contains the one
   port components: \textbf{R}, \textbf{C} and \textbf{I} in each of
   the two possible causalities.

   Note that the \textbf{R} has no prefered causality and, in this
   case, a causal stroke must be provided by the user. On the other
   hand, the \textbf{C} and \textbf{I} components are assigned
   prefered causality by MTT in the 3rd and 5th cases where no stroke
   is assigned by ther user. In the 4th and 6th cases, the user
   provides a causal stroke to put the components into derivative
   causality. \Ref{fig:OnePorts_cbg-noargs.ps} shows the causality
   automatically completed for the 3rd and 5th cases.
   
   Section \Ref{sec:OnePorts_ode-noargs.tex} gives the system equations, $y_1$ to
   $y_6$ are the outputs (with the given causality) of the 6
   components and $u_1$ to $u_6$ are the coresponding inputs. $x_1$
   and $x_2$ are the states of the 3rd and 5th cases (ie integrated
   flow and effort respectively), $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the
   corresponding quantities for the the 4th and 6th cases, the two
   components in derivative causality.
