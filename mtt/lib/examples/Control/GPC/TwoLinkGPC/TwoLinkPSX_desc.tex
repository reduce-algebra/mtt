   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{TwoLinkPSX} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{TwoLinkPSX_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:TwoLinkPSX_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:TwoLinkPSX_sub}.

This is a heirachical version of the example from Section 10.5 of
"Metamodelling".  It uses the compound components: {\bf ROD}.  {\bf
ROD} is essentially as described in Figure 10.2.
There is no gravity included in this model.

This system has a number of dynamic elements (those corresponding to translation
motion) in derivative causality, thus the system is represnted as a
Differential-Algebraic Equation (Section
\Ref{sec:TwoLinkPSX_dae.tex}). Hovever, this is of contrained-state form and
therfore can be written as a set of constrained-state equations (Section
\Ref{sec:TwoLinkPSX_cse.tex}). The corresponding ordinary differential
equation is complicated due to the trig functions involved in
inverting the E matrix.

As well as the standard representation the ``robot-form'' equations
appear in Section  \Ref{sec:TwoLinkPSX_rfe}.
