   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{msdP} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{msdP_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:msdP_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:msdP_sub}.


 \textbf{msdP} is a simple Mass-Spring-Damper system with 
 force input and position output. It is set up to provide a specification system
 for each link of the two-link maipulator. This is appropriate because
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  it has compatible physical behaviour with the system itself,
 \item it specifies two decoupled systems,
 \item it has linear behaviour and
 \item it has a simple performance interpretation in terms of system
   rise-time and overshoot.
 \end{itemize}
