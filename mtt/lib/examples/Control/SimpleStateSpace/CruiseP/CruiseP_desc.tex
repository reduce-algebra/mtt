This is a simple teaching example to illustrate compensator design via
observer/state-feedback methods.

The system represents a simple model of a vehicle moving along a road.
The vehicle
\begin{itemize}
\item has mass $m$
\item is driven by a force $u=F$
\item has velocity $v$ 
\item has momentum $p=mv$ 
\item has a distance along the road $y=d$
\item The system states are taken to be:
  \begin{equation}
    x = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      p \\ d
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}\end{itemize}
