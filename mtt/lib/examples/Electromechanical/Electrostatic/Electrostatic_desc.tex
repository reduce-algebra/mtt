   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Electrostatic} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Electrostatic_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Electrostatic_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Electrostatic_sub}.

This is a simple electrostatic speaker using the \textbf{CM}
transducer component together with an electrical \textbf{R} and a
mechanical \textbf{R} and \textbf{C} components to model a compliant
support for the moving plate. See Karnopp, Margolis and Rosenberg
Section 8.2 for a similar example.
