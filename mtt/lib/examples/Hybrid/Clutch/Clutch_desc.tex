   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Clutch} is displayed in
   Figure \Ref{Clutch_abg} and its label file is listed in Section
   \Ref{sec:Clutch_lbl}.  The subsystems are listed in Section
   \Ref{sec:Clutch_sub}.  The details of the DC motor and the load are
   hidden behind a word bond graph so as to focus on the clutch
   mechanism as modelled by the \textbf{CSW} component.
  It is natural to model the clutch shaft by a
compliance to absorb the shock of engaging the clutch; therefore the
drive model contains a \textbf{CSW} component.


Figure \ref{fig:Clutch_odeso-noargs.ps}, shows the angular velocities of the motor
and load.  The clutch is engaged from time $t$ given by $0<t<15$; and
a unit input voltage is applied at time $t=0$. All initial conditions
are zero.
