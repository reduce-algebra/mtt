   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{idNonlinearTanks} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:idRC_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:idRC_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:idRC_sub}.

   
   This example illustrates the sensitivity approach to model-based
   system identification\footnote{Peter J Gawthrop, \emph{Sensitivity
       Bond Graphs}, Journal Franklin Institute, \textbf{337}, 2000,
     pp 907--922}.

   The system compprises two non-linear tanks (see the paper for details).
   The method identifies four parameters: the two initial states ans
   the two parameters of the non-linear flow resistance.

   To see the results, type:
