   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{iRC2c} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{iRC2c_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:iRC2c_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:iRC2c_sub}.

This example gives the inverse of a double RC circuit with
\emph{collocated} sensor/actuator pairing.
