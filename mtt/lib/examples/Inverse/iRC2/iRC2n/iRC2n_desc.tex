   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{iRC2n} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{iRC2n_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:iRC2n_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:iRC2n_sub}.

This example gives the inverse of a double RC circuit with
\emph{non-collocated} sensor/actuator pairing.
