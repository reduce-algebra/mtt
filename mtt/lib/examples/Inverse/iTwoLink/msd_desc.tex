   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{msd} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{msd_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:msd_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:msd_sub}.


 \textbf{msd} is a simple Mass-Spring-Damper system with collocated
 force and velocity. It is set up to provide a specification system
 for each link of the two-link maipulator. This is appropriate because
 \begin{itemize}
 \item  it has compatible physical behaviour with the system itself,
 \item it specifies two decoupled systems,
 \item it has linear behaviour and
 \item it has a simple performance interpretation in terms of system
   rise-time and overshoot.
 \end{itemize}
