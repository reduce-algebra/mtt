%SUMMARY TwoLinkxyc: two-link manipulator with collocated tip source-sensors.
%DESCRIPTION This is related to a heirachical version of the 
%DESCRIPTION example from Section 10.5 of "Metamodelling".
%DESCRIPTION It uses two compound components: ROD and GRA
%DESCRIPTION ROD is essentially as described in Figure 10.2
%DESCRIPTION GRAV represents gravity by a vertical accelleration
%DESCRIPTION as in Section 10.9 of "Metamodelling"
%DESCRIPTION except that the  collocated  source-sensors act at the
%DESCRIPTION tip rather than at the joints.
