Gino is a symbolic toolbox for octave (www.octave.org) using ginsh -
the shell interface to ginac (www.ginac.de).

ginsh.m provides a low-level octave interface to ginsh. All of the
ginsh functions are implemented by octave functions of the form
g_fun(arglist).

All in and out arguments of the toolbox functions are octave strings
containing valid ginsh expressions. Where appropriate, these can be
turned into matlab scalars, matrices and lists using octave's eval
function. Spurious output is avoided by setting
default_eval_print_flag=0.

This provides a clear division between symbolic expressions (always
contained in strings) and octave expressions. It also allows the
powerful octave string machinery to be used to manipulate symbolic
expressions.

gino_examples.m contains some introductory examples.
