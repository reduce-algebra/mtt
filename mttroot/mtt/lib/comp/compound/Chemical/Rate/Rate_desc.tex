   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Rate} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:Rate_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Rate_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Rate_sub}.


This component represents rate of reaction equations corresponding to
the chemical reaction:
\begin{equation}
  \text{nA} \rightarrow \text{B}
\end{equation}
The relevant equations are
\begin{equation}
  \begin{align}
     \frac{dc_a}{dt} &= k_a c_a^n e^{-\frac{q_a}{T}} \tag{Rate of reaction}\\
     Q &= h_a k_a c_a^n e^{-\frac{q_a}{T}} \tag{Heat of reaction}
  \end{align}
\end{equation}
where $\frac{dc_a}{dt}$ is the rate of change of concentration of
species A and $Q$ is the corresponding heat generated.
