    {Simple lower-leg model}
   
    A schematic of a simple muscle model with skeleton appears in
    Figure \Ref{fig:LowerLeg1_pic} and the acausal bond graph is
    displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:LowerLeg1_abg.ps} and its label file
    is listed in Section \Ref{sec:LowerLeg1_lbl.txt}.  The subsystems
    are listed in Section \Ref{sec:LowerLeg1_sub}.  The model is a
    rough approximation of the lower leg, knee joint and thigh muscles
    with the lower leg horizontal.

    The components are:
    \begin{description}
    \item[F\_1 and F\_2] the force inputs to the upper and lower muscles
    \item[m\_1 and m\_2] the upper and lower muscles
    \item[r\_1 and r\_2] the transformers reflecting the geometry of the
      muscle attachments
    \item[m] load mass
    \item[mg] force due to gravity.
    \end{description}
