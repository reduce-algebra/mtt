   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{sFP} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:sFP_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:sFP_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:sFP_sub}.

This is the sensitivity version of the \textbf{FP} (flow/power
real-pseuso component).

The standard ports implement the CR:
\begin{align}
  T_1 &= T_2 \\
  Q &= S*T_2
\end{align}

The \emph{sensitivity} ports implement the CR:
\begin{align}
  T_1^\prime &= T_2^\prime \\
  Q^\prime &= S^\prime *T_2 + S*T_2^\prime
\end{align}
