   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{sRS} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:sRS_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:sRS_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:sRS_sub}.

   This component implements the \emph{sensitivity} component
   corresponding to the \textbf{RS} component.
   \begin{itemize}
   \item The non-thermal side is just the sensitivity R component
     \textbf{sR}.
   \item The thermal side implements:
     \begin{equation}
      \dot{s} = \frac{ef}{T}
     \end{equation}
     \begin{equation}
      {\dot{s}}^\prime = \frac{(e^\prime f + ef^\prime)T - efT^\prime }{T^2}
     \end{equation}
     where the prime indicates the derivative with respect to the
     sensitivity parameter.
   \end{itemize}
