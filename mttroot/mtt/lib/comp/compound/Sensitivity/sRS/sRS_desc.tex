   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{sRS} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:sFMR_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:sFMR_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:sFMR_sub}.


This is the sensitivity version of the \textbf{FMR} (flow-modulated
resistor) component.

In the linear case, the CR of the standard port is:
\begin{equation}
  e = mrf
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the effort, $m$ the (flow) modulation, $r$ the
``resistance'' and $f$ the flow.

The corresponding sensitivity CR is:
\begin{equation}
  e^\prime  = m^\prime rf + mr^\prime f + mrf^\prime
\end{equation}
