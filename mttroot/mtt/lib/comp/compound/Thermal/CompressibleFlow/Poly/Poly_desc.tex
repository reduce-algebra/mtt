   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Poly} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Poly_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Poly_lbl}.

This four-port component computes the tempertature following a
polytropic expansion using:
\begin{equation}
  T_2 = T_1 \left ( \frac{P_2}{P_1} \right )^\alpha
\end{equation}
where $\alpha = \frac{n-1}{n}$ and $n$ is the coefficient of
polytropic expansion.
