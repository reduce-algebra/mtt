%SUMMARY hPipe: Pipe for compressible fluid with heat transfer and heat storage.

%DESCRIPTION hPipe represents an ideal (energy conserving) pipe carrying a
%DESCRIPTION fluid with heat transfer. To ensure energy conservation, power bonds are used and
%DESCRIPTION connected by (energy conserving) TF components.
%DESCRIPTION It is assumed that the working fluid is an ideal gas (gas constant r) and that a mass
%DESCRIPTION m_t is stored within pipe with a volume v_t.

%DESCRIPTION Parameter 1: m_t (mass in pipe)
%DESCRIPTION Parameter 2: v_t (volume of pipe)
%DESCRIPTION Parameter 3: r (gas constant)
%DESCRIPTION Typical lable entry
