   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Conv} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Conv_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Conv_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Conv_sub}.

The \textbf{Conv} component represents one way isenentropic flow of 
fluid though a pipe. Externally, it has true energy bonds: $P$/$\dot V$
(Pressure/volume-flow) representing hydraulic energy and $T$/$\dot
S$(Temperature/Entropy-flow) representing convected thermal energy.

Internally, however, the thermal part is represented by a pseudo bond
graph which computes the flow of internal energy $\dot E$ from the
upstream temperature $T_1$ and the mass flow rate $\dot m$ as:
\begin{equation}
  \dot E = c_p T_1 \dot m
\end{equation}
The $AF$ component makes the $FMR$ component use $T_1$ rather than
$T_1-T_2$.

The two \textbf{ES} components provide the conversion from true to
psuedo thermal bonds and vice versa.

%The pipe has an resistance to flow represented by the \textbf{RS}
%component labeled `r' which can be linear or nonlinear. The hydraulic
%energy loss reappears on the thermal bond of this (energy-conserving)
%\textbf{RS} component.
