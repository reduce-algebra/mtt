Component \textbf{RT1} is a two port thermal resistor with true power
bonds. Internally, it has a pseudo Bond Graph representation, and the
corresponding thermal resistance just acts as an ordinary one-port
\textbf{R} component.
Unlike the {\bf RT} component, it is {\em one-sided\/} in the snese
that the paper flow depends only on the upstream temperature. It is
useful for modelling radiation via the Stefan-Boltzmann law when using
the {\bf StefanBoltzmann} CR.


This one-sidedness is achieved using the {\bf AF} component to isolate
the intrnal {\bf R} component from the downstream temperature.
