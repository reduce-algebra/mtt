   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{aRC} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{aRC_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:aRC_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:aRC_sub}.

The system \textbf{aRC} is the simple electrical rc circuit shown in
Figure \Ref{aRC_abg}. It can be regarded as a single-input
single-output system with input $e_1$ and output $e_2$.

The two resistors ($r_1$ and $r_2$) are in series; this give an
undercausal system with a corresponding algebraic loop. The loop is
broken by adding the {\bf SS} component ``loop'' to localise the
algabraic equation byh choosing the corresponding flow such that the
corresponding effort is zero. This algebraic equation appears in
Section \Ref{sec:aRC_dae-noargs.tex}.

This loop is algbraicly solved to give the ordinary differential
equation of Section \Ref{sec:aRC_ode-A.tex} and the transfer function of
Section \Ref{sec:aRC_tf-A.tex}.
