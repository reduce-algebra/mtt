This is a simple teaching example to illustrate compensator design via
observer/state-feedback methods.

The system represents a simple model of a DC motor including armature
resistance $r_m$, armature inductance $l_m$, motor constant $k_m$,
inertia $j_m$ and friction $b_m$.

The DC motor has
\begin{itemize}
\item output angular velocity $y = \omega$
\item input voltage $u = v$
\item $\lambda = Li$ where $i$ is the armature current
\item angular momentum $p=j_m \omega$.
\item system states given by
  \begin{equation}
    x = 
    \begin{pmatrix}
      \lambda \\ \omega
    \end{pmatrix}
  \end{equation}
\end{itemize}
