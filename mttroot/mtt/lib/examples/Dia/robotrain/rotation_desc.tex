% Generated by MTT on Sun Sep 12 22:06:34 BST 2004.

The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{rotation} is
displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:rotation_abg.ps}  
.
The label file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:rotation_lbl} and the
subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:rotation_sub}.

\subsubsection{rotate\_z constitutive relationship}
The rotation between body and Earth axes is achieved using the ``rotate\_z'' constitutive relationship which is implemented as a Reduce file (.cr) and a Perl module (.pm) to permit the model to be built with or without MTT's -no-reduce option.
