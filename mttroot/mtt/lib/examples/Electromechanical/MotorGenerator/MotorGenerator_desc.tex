   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{MotorGenerator} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{fig:MotorGenerator_abg.ps} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:MotorGenerator_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:MotorGenerator_sub}.

This example illustates:
\begin{itemize}
\item The reuse of the DC model as both a motor and a generator
\item The assignment of a \emph{domain} and \emph{units} to component ports.
\end{itemize}

The command:
\begin{verbatim}
mtt -I MotorGenerator ese r
\end{verbatim}
gives the following output (irrelevant parts ommitted)
