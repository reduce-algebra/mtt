   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{LeakyCylinder} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{LeakyCylinder_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:LeakyCylinder_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:LeakyCylinder_sub}.

This example roughly corresponds to the Example in section 12.4.3
(Fig. 12.17) of Karnopp, Margolis and Rosenberg (1990). It is a pseudo bond
graph representation based on the ``thermal acummulator'' of  section
12.4.1 and the ``isentropic nozzle'' of section 12.4.2 of that book.
