   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{LeakyCylinder} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{LeakyCylinder_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:LeakyCylinder_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:LeakyCylinder_sub}.

This example roughly corresponds to the Example in section 12.4.3
(Fig. 12.17) of Karnopp, Margolis and Rosenberg (1990). It is a pseudo bond
graph representation based on the ``thermal accumulator'' of  section
12.4.1 and the ``isentropic nozzle'' of section 12.4.2 of that book.

Notes added by PJG 10 June 03. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The parameters/states used in the simulation (odeso) are
  meaningless at the moment.
\item The steady-state parameters (sspar.r) need to be calculated; at
  the moment, the state mattrices (sm) are in terms of the
  steady-state states.  
\end{enumerate}
