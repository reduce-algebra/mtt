   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{Weir} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{Weir_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:Weir_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:Weir_sub}.

Each weir is modeled by two {\bf ISW} components: one for flow
left-right and one for flow right-left. The switching is such that
they become non-return valves when the left hand (respectively
right-hand) level reaches an appropriate value. The parameters appear
in Section \Ref{sec:Weir_numpar.txt} and the switching conditions in
Section \Ref{sec:Weir_input.txt}.
