   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{itwolink} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{itwolink_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:itwolink_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:itwolink_sub}.

This example illustrates the inversion of  two link manipulator
dynamics using two identical  simple mass-spring-damper systems as
specification systems.

The velocities $\omega_1=\omega_2$ specified by the specification
systems are given in Figure \Ref{fig:itwolink_odeso.ps-itwolink-t1s}
together with the input defined in Section \Ref{sec:itwolink_input}.
The torques $\tau_1$ and $\tau_2$ required to give the these
velocities specified by the specification system are given in Figures
\Ref{fig:itwolink_odeso.ps-itwolink-t1} and
\Ref{fig:itwolink_odeso.ps-itwolink-t2} respectively.

The corresponding velocity/torque diagrams for  joint 1 appears in
\Ref{fig:itwolink_odeso.ps-itwolink-t1s:itwolink-t1}.
