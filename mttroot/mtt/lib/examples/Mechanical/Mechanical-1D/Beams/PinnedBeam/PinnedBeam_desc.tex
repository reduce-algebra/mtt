The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{PinnedBeam} is displayed in
Figure \Ref{fig:PinnedBeam_abg.ps} and its label file is listed in
Section \Ref{sec:PinnedBeam_lbl}.  The subsystems are listed in Section
\Ref{sec:PinnedBeam_sub}.
   
This example represents the dynamics of a uniform beam with two pinned
ends. The left-hand end is driven by a torque input and the
corresponding collocated angular velocity is measured.  The beam is
approximated by 20 equal lumps using the Bernoulli-Euler.  Because the
two end lumps have different causality to the rest of the beam lumps,
they are represented seperately.  The system has 40 states (20 modes
of vibration), 1 input and 1 output.

The beam was made of aluminium with physical dimensions and constants
given in Table \ref{tab:beam}. The derived beam constants are given by the
formulae:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:formulae}
  \begin{align}
    EI &= E \times w \frac{1}{12} t_b^3\\
    \rho A &= \rho \times w t_b
  \end{align}
\end{equation}

The system parameters are also given in Section
\Ref{sec:PinnedBeam_numpar.tex}.

Standard modal analysis give the theoretical system resonant
frequencies (based on the Bernoulli-Euler beam with the same values of
$EI$ and $\rho A$). The system anti-resonances correspond to those of
the \emph{inverse} system with reversed causality, that the driven
pinned end is replaced by a clamped end; again modal analysis of the
inverse system gives the system anti resonances. The model and
theoretical values are compared in Table \ref{tab:freq} for the first
5 modes. (This table was generated using the script MakeFreqTable.m)
