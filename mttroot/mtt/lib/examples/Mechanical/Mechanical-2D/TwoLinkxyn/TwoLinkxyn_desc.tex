   The acausal bond graph of system \textbf{twolinkxyn} is
   displayed in Figure \Ref{twolinkxyn_abg} and its label
   file is listed in Section \Ref{sec:twolinkxyn_lbl}.
   The subsystems are listed in Section \Ref{sec:twolinkxyn_sub}.

This system is identical to  \textbf{twolink} except that there are
now two non-collocated input-output pairs: The torque input to joint 1
-- x velocity of the tip and the torque input to joint 2
-- y velocity of the tip. 

It uses two compound components: {\bf ROD} and {\bf GRAV}.  {\bf ROD}
is essentially as described in Figure 10.2 of "Metamodelling" and {\bf
GRAV} represents gravity by a vertical acceleration as in Section
10.9 of "Metamodelling"
