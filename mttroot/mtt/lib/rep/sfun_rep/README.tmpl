To build a Simulink funtion of the <mtt_model_name> model without using MTT:

mex -I. <mtt_model_name>_sfun.c

The input block can be created with:

mex -I. <mtt_model_name>_sfun_input.c

If numerical solution of algebraic equations is also required:

mex -I. <mtt_model_name>_sfun_ae.c

The interface block can be created with

mex -I. <mtt_model_name>_sfun_interface.c
